//We have defined a function, forecast, that takes an array as an argument. Modify the function using slice() to extract information from the argument array and return a new array that contains the elements 'warm' and 'sunny'.
// The next method we will cover is slice(). slice(), rather than modifying an array, copies, or extracts, a given number of elements to a new array, leaving the array it is called upon untouched. slice() takes only 2 parameters â€” the first is the index at which to begin extraction, and the second is the index at which to stop extraction (extraction will occur up to, but not including the element at this index). Consider this:

function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var newArr =  arr.slice(2, 4);
  return newArr;
}

// Only change code above this line
console.log(forecast(['cold', 'rainy', 'warm', 'sunny', 'cool', 'thunderstorms']));
